```typescript
const agents: Agent[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Legal Assistant',
    bot: 'Legal Contract Agent:Legal Contract Bot', // Maps to SDK bot
    flow: 'Legal Contract Agent:Legal Contract Bot', // Maps to SDK flow
    // ... other properties
  }
];
```

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd samples/web-ui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
